# Swarm Research Workbench

A reusable LLM coordination experiment surface at **`/research`**, alongside the tumor Experiment Lab. This is the first multi-domain research increment—not a claim of clinical, financial, or publication readiness.

## What it makes measurable

| Protocol | Actual behavior | Call ceiling per selected model/task |
|---|---|---:|
| Single | One blind proposal per model; separate baseline rows | 1 |
| Independent vote | Three blind samples per model; deterministic strict majority | 3 |
| Peer review | Blind proposals → named peer critiques → revised proposals | 3 |
| Signal board | Task-scoped typed claims; two snapshot-isolated revision rounds; one-round TTL | 3 |

Model disagreement can abstain. Missing/invalid required messages cannot become consensus. All proposals, critiques, revisions and failures retain source attribution. A short **public** rationale is requested, not private chain-of-thought. No model-as-judge chooses the correct answer; deterministic reference scoring is separate from inference.

Protocol ensembles have equal call/output-token ceilings, **not equal input-token costs**. The single baseline is cheaper. Compare observed prompt tokens, output tokens and latency. One-model peer review is self-review, not model diversity. A proper scientific comparison still requires same-model and heterogeneous teams, repeated sampling seeds, token-matched controls, pre-registration and held-out replication.

## Collective evidence exchange

`evidence_exchange` gives three independent contexts of each selected model different evidence shards (source order, round-robin). Each worker chooses up to three source IDs to share alongside its public finding. The host delivers those exact source passages, attributed to the sender, in one frozen round-zero snapshot expiring after round one. Each worker then revises independently; a strict majority determines the group answer. Unselected sources are not broadcast. Invalid findings never propagate. Prompts, response schemas and citation validation all use the worker's visible evidence, not the full task. Empty shards remain empty rather than borrowing hidden evidence.

`evidence_isolated` is the sharing-off control: identical initial shards/instructions and worker seeds, same six-call ceiling, but no findings cross between workers. `solo_refine` gives one agent all evidence from the start and six successive answer checks. Each selected model gets its own cell in these three modes. This isolates **knowledge diversity**, not heterogeneous-model cooperation. Equal calls and output ceilings do not match input-token cost; compare actual usage. The original four protocols retain their original full-evidence behavior and default selection.

`evidence_sources` is a message-content ablation: the same three partial-view workers select evidence, but recipients receive only their peers' cited passages and attribution, not the peers' answers or briefs. Own previous findings remain visible. Initial prompts, grammar and derived seeds match `evidence_exchange`; each arm makes fresh calls, so experimental pairing must still verify returned initial contents and transported passages. No completion replay is hidden behind this mode. The six-call/output ceilings match, but source-only prompts are shorter: this is not compute matching, and a null result is not evidence of equivalence. The original default selections are unchanged.

The Collective behaviour panel groups by the actual question and labels Researcher A/B/C or Solo researcher. Stored initial/final answers, expandable exact starting/received passages, sender attribution and public peer claims make the difference between source-only and full-finding exchange visible. Peer claims are unverified; invalid raw model text cannot override a stored null answer. Machine identifiers remain in expandable provenance and JSON/CSV exports. A changed answer is not necessarily better; compare task correctness including all failures. The app has no retained-experience learning, adaptive task allocation, automatic experiment tuning or guarantee that sharing wins. This is one bounded evidence-sharing behaviour, not the finished hive mind.

## Authorized cloud study archives

The interactive builder and execution API remain local-only. Explicitly authorized, separately budgeted cloud studies can be imported as saved reports, with their hosted model/cohort clearly labelled; an unregistered cloud model key cannot silently replay through the local builder. These reports do not establish equality with local quantized weights.

`shared_initial_fork_v1` reports explicitly reuse common initial public findings across communication conditions. Per-condition rows allocate those initials to each condition; physical usage totals count actual requests once. JSON keeps the full report, and CSV preserves fork origin attribution plus a separate accounting row. Incomplete physical usage remains unknown, and unknown billing is not displayed as zero. Every revision/solo/vote request remains fresh; this archive support is not a hidden inference cache or an automatic cloud fallback.

## Public task tracks

`backend/research_fixtures/tasks.json` pins 200 projected tasks: 50 development + 50 evaluation examples per domain, selected in SHA256(source ID) order after recorded admission checks. Per-run subsets use SHA256(seed:task ID) ordering and record all selected IDs. Fixture byte hash is checked on every load.

- **PubMedQA**: abstract comprehension, choices yes/no/maybe. Official labeled corpus and public test-ID split, revision `1cbae8e92f72f20c8d3747cbb3bf5bc53554d997`. Only question/context reach agents, not `LONG_ANSWER`, labels or judgments. Attribution: Jin et al. (2019), https://pubmedqa.github.io/. Repository MIT notice does not establish blanket rights over underlying article abstracts.
- **FinQA-derived numeric answer QA**: question and full supplied text/table, not gold retrieval fields/program/explanation. Revision `0f16e2867befa6840783e58be38c9efb9229d742`; original dev/test remain disjoint. Explicit output units, finite Decimal arithmetic and absolute tolerance 0.01. Percentage answers use points; both percentage execution conventions are checked before admission. Ambiguous, nonnumeric, label-inconsistent and overlong cases are excluded **before inference**, with every ID/reason retained in the bundle audit. This is a deliberately selected subset and **not official FinQA program/execution accuracy**. Attribution: Chen et al. (2021), https://finqasite.github.io/; dataset CC BY 4.0, repository code MIT.

Public benchmark exposure to model training is unknown. Locally held-out does not mean model-unseen. No PHI, patient upload, clinical recommendations, finance execution, tools or arbitrary model URLs are accepted.

Rebuild with `PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/build_research_fixtures.py RAW_DIRECTORY`. Download only the four pinned URLs declared in the script, retain their hashes, and review any proposed fixture/hash update; the app never downloads data automatically. The full raw datasets live outside the source checkout.

## Explicit message-output policy

The builder defaults new runs to `constrained_short_v1`, while `prompt_only` remains selectable. API clients omitting `output_policy` retain the original prompt-only behavior. Saved reports without this field are displayed as legacy prompt-only; their stored bytes are not rewritten.

Constrained mode uses a task/role-specific llama.cpp JSON schema: exact fields, allowed public answer choices (or a bounded decimal string), supplied evidence IDs, exact critique target IDs, at most three evidence IDs and a public brief of at most 160 characters. Numeric strings use an optional sign, 1–16 integer digits and optionally 1–8 fractional digits (write `0.5`, not `.5`); `null` remains available for abstention. The grammar itself bounds numeric repetition because a regex can bypass a decoder's separate `maxLength` constraint. Deterministic validation still rejects duplicate IDs, truncations and invalid replies. Schemas and the actual concise instructions are recorded with the request, including failures. Endpoints that reject schemas fail visibly, with no fallback or hidden retry. The original 256-token default remains unchanged.

The selected policy appears on saved reports, in JSON/CSV exports, and in each event's inspectable requested schema. This is an explicit intervention to reduce malformed communication and unfinished replies, **not an accuracy guarantee**. Compare format completion separately from correctness, preserve all requested-task denominators, and use the same models/tasks/generation limits. A historical before/after rerun is not a randomized causal study or evidence of swarm superiority.

## Source-backed arithmetic (experimental, opt-in)

`source_calculation_v1` is a separate intervention, not a new default. On decimal claims/revisions, the model outputs one `operation`, ordered `operands` containing exact public `evidence_id`/numeric `quote` pairs, and a short `brief`. Host Decimal arithmetic—not the model's proposed number—produces the answer. Choice tasks and critiques retain constrained-short behavior; strict-majority voting and failure denominators do not change.

Operations: `identity` (one operand), `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `percent_of`, `percent_change` (two), or `abstain` (zero). For ordered operands a,b: subtraction is a−b, division is a/b, percent-of is 100a/b, and percent-change is 100(a−b)/b with a=new and b=old. Results round half-up to two decimals. Percent source tokens represent percentage points. Only one operation is supported: multi-step calculations or unsupported unit conversions should abstain. No arbitrary expressions, model-generated code, extra model calls, retries, external tools or evaluator labels are admitted.

Source binding rejects fabricated/partial numeric quotes, stripped signs, wrong arity, division by zero and out-of-bound arithmetic. Supported quotes use ASCII digits, optional sign/dollar prefix, comma grouping, leading-dot decimals, accounting parentheses and percent suffixes (spaces/tabs allowed inside those forms); at most 24 integer digits, 12 decimal places and 64 quote characters. Source neighbours use conservative ASCII word/number and prose/table-separator boundaries. Unsupported Unicode signs or adjacent context and exponent notation reject rather than being normalized; valid but unsupported source layouts may therefore abstain/fail validation. An accepted quote proves only that the numeric token occurs in the cited source. **It does not prove the right row, year, unit or operation was selected.** Correct arithmetic can still give an incorrect answer. Medical interpretation and genuine disagreement handling are not repaired by this feature.

Saved events retain the raw plan and a separate computed payload with normalized source operands, operation, result and limitations. The trace explorer shows a source-backed calculation panel; JSON and CSV retain the complete payload. Earlier stored reports and their hashes are not rewritten. Experiments must freeze code/IDs/settings before held-out use, compare against `constrained_short_v1` under the same budgets, and retain invalid/abstained cases. A small paired pilot is not a high-accuracy guarantee or evidence of swarm superiority.

## Accuracy requirements are evidence gates

Each domain/variant reports task successes over **all requested tasks**, answered accuracy, coverage, abstentions, invalid responses, transport failures, one-sided 95% Wilson lower bound and minimum 30 cases. Failed/missing evidence stays unknown; small samples remain insufficient. An all-abstain/all-error run cannot show answered accuracy as zero or 100%. The Wilson bound is approximate selected-sample evidence, not a future reliability guarantee; it is not simultaneous multiple-comparison correction.

A `meets_sample_target` label means only that this selected sample meets the chosen lower-bound threshold. It is not clinical/financial approval. Repeated browsing/tuning on the evaluation split invalidates independent evaluation claims; the app does not enforce an experiment preregistration/one-shot lock yet.

## Local model and execution boundary

`backend/research_models.py` pins two machine-local llama.cpp endpoints:

- `qwen`: Qwen3.8 27B abliterated Q3_K, `qwen38-abliterated`, loopback `:8301`.
- `phi4`: existing experimental Phi4 mini finance F16 fine-tune, `antelligence-phi4-finance`, loopback `:18302`.

Model aliases, paths, server build, template hash and local weight SHA256 observations are recorded. Local file hashes are **not attestation of server memory or training provenance**. Phi4's training source/benchmark exposure is unverified; do not infer a clean finance advantage. Catalog checks are read-only, not inference or model-quality endorsements. The old `:8090` service is a cloud proxy and is intentionally not in this local roster.

Explicit temperature, seed and output bounds; no credential lookup, environment proxies, redirects, cloud fallback, response replay or completion cache. Prompt caching is disabled for these comparisons. API cost is zero; electricity/hardware cost is not measured. One job at a time per shared SQLite target via an OS file lock, sequential calls, maximum 600 calls/3600 seconds, bounded HTTP timeout. Wall-time is checked between calls and limits the pending call timeout, not a hard real-time process kill.

Jobs start only on an explicit POST. SQLite persists admissions, reserved call counts, returned events and completed cells. A cancelled job stops after the current call; it never silently resumes. Restart marks orphaned running jobs interrupted under the same lock; historical completed reports remain unchanged. Unfinished tasks remain in denominators, and missing returned usage is unknown rather than measured zero.

`ANTELLIGENCE_RESEARCH_DB` optionally selects a separate research SQLite database; otherwise the existing run DB is used with a separate table. This permits retaining all historical tumor/experiment records unchanged.

Endpoints: `GET /research/catalog`, `POST /research/runs`, `GET /research/runs`, `GET /research/runs/<uuid>`, `POST /research/runs/<uuid>/cancel`. Existing simulation/Experiment Lab routes are retained. Preview makes no private research requests.

## Development verification

Use the project test interpreter and offline/chain-denied flags. Focused suite:

```sh
PYTHON_DOTENV_DISABLED=1 ANTELLIGENCE_OFFLINE=1 ANTELLIGENCE_ENABLE_BLOCKCHAIN_TX=0 CHAIN_READ_ENABLED=0 CHAIN_WRITE_ENABLED=0 \
  python -m pytest tests/test_swarm_core.py tests/test_research_data.py tests/test_research_models.py tests/test_research_api.py -q
node --experimental-strip-types --test frontend/tests/*.test.ts
npm --prefix frontend run build
npm --prefix frontend run lint
```

`frontend/tests/research_browser.py` is **live local-model** acceptance, not a mocked UI test. It starts 40 real model calls unless `RESEARCH_RUN_ID` selects existing evidence. Requires an interpreter with Playwright/Chromium, `ANTELLIGENCE_E2E_OUTPUT`, and optional frontend/API URLs. Do not confuse the test venv with the separate browser interpreter. No metered calls are needed.

## Vision contribution and unfinished research

The [hive-memory research extension](HIVE_MEMORY_RESEARCH.md) maps broad persistent memory, a bounded Queen and checkable critical-task families. Its inert coldroom testbed and recorded replay use handwritten policies and a scratch database, not live LLM agents or an OS security sandbox.

The [Fugu-inspired research investigation](FUGU_RESEARCH.md) distinguishes learned routing, selective information access and cross-task memory, and includes a reproducible diagnostic of existing collective traces. It is research evidence, not a new deployed coordination policy or a successor evaluation.

The signal board operationalizes typed, expiring agent communication; peer critique makes agent-to-agent review inspectable; model/protocol controls and evidence gates begin the reproducibility layer beyond tumor physics. Blockchain remains a future commitment/provenance adapter, not the hot communication bus. `proof_ok` remains false.

Next research stages are selective escalation, fair token-budget/adaptive policies, multiple framework adapters against this same task contract, domain expert adjudication of references, independent unseen evaluations, failure-slice analysis, calibration and adversarial robustness. Patient-aware 3D simulations, learned episodic Queen, signal reinforcement/conflict policies and actual cryptographic verification are separate uncompleted vision items. Do not replace them with a benchmark dashboard and call the whole platform finished.
