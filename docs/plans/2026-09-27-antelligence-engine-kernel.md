# Antelligence Engine — Shared Kernel Design & Implementation Plan

> **Status (2026-09-27):** P1–P7 built, plus P4a (hive modules imported), P4b
> (task-DAG world) and the trust-layer parity check; P8 done in reduced form
> (see section 15).
> **Branch:** `engine/v1` (from `main`), one commit per phase, tags `engine-p1`…`engine-p8`.

## 1. What we are building (one paragraph)

One **engine** (the `antelligence/` package) that every swarm experiment runs on.
The engine owns *how agents coordinate and how we trust what they share*: local
views, typed expiring signals, provenance-bearing memory, admission checks, a
model-free verifier, and an append-only event log that becomes the run's proof.
**Worlds** plug into the engine and own only *what exists, what an agent can see,
what an action does, and how a run is scored* — tumor, foraging, task-DAG, and
research QA are four worlds on the same engine.

> Pitch: **a verifiable stigmergic substrate** — agents coordinate only through a
> typed, expiring, provenance-bearing signal field; a model-free verifier owns
> outcomes; the chain notarizes runs.

## 2. Why

| Today | Problem | Engine answer |
|---|---|---|
| 3 swarm systems (ants, tumor nanobots, LLM research) in one repo | No shared code for signals, LLM calls, logging | One kernel, many worlds |
| 3 pheromone implementations (biofvm, dict grid, `tumor_hunt.PheromoneGrid`) | Drift, inconsistent semantics | One `Signal` + `SignalField` |
| Queen / knowledge graph see the whole tumor | Violates "no agent sees the whole picture" | `LocalView` enforced by types; Queen emits signals |
| `QueenNanobot.step()` never called by the model loop | Episodic adaptation is dead code in the app | Scheduler owns the loop for every policy |
| Per-bot blocking LLM calls + sync chain tx inside the tick | Slow, fragile, untestable | Async batched provider; async provenance outbox |
| Paper machinery (memory, transport, verifier) lives outside the repo | App and paper are different projects | Trust layer is part of the kernel |

**Rule of the architecture:** the kernel never imports a world. Worlds import the
kernel. That is what lets one flag (e.g. "shared memory on/off") mean the exact
same code in every world.

```

Key properties:

- **Locality by type.** A policy receives a `LocalView`; it has no handle to the world.
- **Deferred visibility.** Signals deposited at tick *t* are sensed at *t+1* — no agent
  sees another's same-tick output, so order of agents does not change results.
- **Outcomes are owned by the verifier.** "I delivered the drug" from an agent is a
  claim; only the verifier writes the outcome.
- **Deterministic.** Seeded RNG per agent per tick; LLM responses cached by request
  hash → a run can be replayed exactly.

## 5. The `Signal` — one envelope for pheromones AND LLM messages

```
Signal {
  id            content hash (stable, dedupable)
  sender        agent id
  kind          found | claimed | depleted | alarm | recruit | claim | critique | ...
  scope         run id + arm (signals never cross experimental arms)
  where         pos (spatial worlds)  or  topic (task / QA worlds)
  payload       small typed dict (world-defined schema)
  cites[]       evidence / record ids this signal relies on
  parent_ids[]  signals this one responds to (causality)
  revision      world revision the sender observed
  ttl           ticks until it expires
}
```

Same object, two worlds:

```
Tumor:        Signal(kind="found",   where=pos(412,318), payload={"cells":7}, ttl=5)
Research QA:  Signal(kind="found",   where=topic("q17"), cites=["e3"],        ttl=1)
```

Lifecycle:

```
 emitted ──► admission ──┬── rejected (logged with reason)
                         │
                         └── deposited in field ──► sensed by agents in range/topic
                                    │
                                    ├── ttl reaches 0 ──────────────► expired
                                    └── world revision moves past ──► stale (not sensed)
```

Field backends:

| Backend | Used by | "Nearby" means |
|---|---|---|
| `GridField` | tumor, foraging | spatial radius; intensity diffuses/decays (via biofvm for tumor) |
| `BoardField` | research QA, task DAG | same topic; round-based TTL (lifted from `swarm_core._run_signal_board`) |

---

## 6. Evidence memory — what the swarm "knows" and whether to trust it

Signals are short-lived. **Memory records** are durable facts with provenance.

```
Record {
  id          content hash
  source      who produced it (agent / world / verifier)
  source_rev  world revision it was based on
  kind        claim | procedure | outcome
  status      candidate | admitted | invalidated | contradicted
  depends_on  [record ids]
  scope       run + arm
}
```

Lifecycle:

```
                ┌──────────── contradiction recorded ────────────┐
                │                                                ▼
 candidate ──► admitted ──► (used by agents) ──► source replaced ──► invalidated
     │                                               │
     └── rejected                                    └── cascade: every record that
                                                         depends_on it → invalidated
```

Rules the kernel enforces:

1. Agents act only on **admitted** records.
2. **Outcome** records are written only by the verifier.
3. Replacing a source **cascades** invalidation to all dependents.
4. Contradicting records block dependent procedures until resolved.
5. Records never leak across experimental arms.

Source: this is the `HiveMemoryStore` design from the DeSci paper (§3.2), which
produced the paper's "0 unsafe acts under drift" result.

## 7. Provenance — two levels, one event log

```
 DURING THE RUN (fact-level)                     AFTER THE RUN (run-level)
 ───────────────────────────                     ─────────────────────────
 signals, memory records, intents,
 admissions, verifier outcomes
            │
            ▼
   events.jsonl  (append-only, ordered) ──► trace_hash ──► proof bundle
                                                             │  run_id, config_hash,
                                                             │  seed, metrics,
                                                             │  trust_tier
                                                             ▼
                                                     provenance outbox (async)
                                                        ├── IPFS pin (CID)
                                                        └── chain (5 public values)
                                                            mock → proof_staged →
                                                            verified_onchain
```

- **Fact-level** answers: *why did agent 3 target that cell, and what was it trusting?*
- **Run-level** answers: *is this run real and reproducible?*
- **Replay** = feed the same config + seed + cached LLM responses → same event log →
  same `trace_hash`.
- Chain writes **never** run inside the tick loop.

---

## 8. Worlds — what each one supplies

A world implements three things; everything else comes from the kernel.

```
class World(Protocol):
    def local_view(self, agent) -> LocalView    # what can this agent see?
    def apply(self, intent) -> Outcome          # what happens when it acts?
    def metrics(self) -> dict                   # how is the run scored?
    (+ a Verifier and a signal payload schema)
```

| | Tumor | Foraging | Task DAG | Research QA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| State | cells, O₂, drug, vessels | grid, food, nest | samples, resources, deps | question, evidence |
| Actions | move, target, deliver | follow target / sweep | propose plan nodes | answer, cite, abstain |
| Score | kill rate, drug efficiency | sweep moves | plan executes | correct answer |
| Rule brain | chemotaxis (ported) | systematic sweep | scripted proposer | — |
| LLM brain | shared `LLMPolicy` | shared `LLMPolicy` | shared `LLMPolicy` | shared `LLMPolicy` |
| Coordination | **kernel (identical)** | **kernel** | **kernel** | **kernel** |

The headline experiment this enables: *flip the same kernel switch (memory,
signals, Queen-emitter) across all worlds and test whether the effect holds
everywhere* — not just in the one world it was tuned in.

```

1. Every commit passes the **full** test suite (legacy + engine).
2. P1–P7 **only add files** under `antelligence/` and `tests/engine/`.
3. Shared files (`pyproject.toml`) are touched once, in P1.
4. World commits never touch each other's folders → P4/P5/P6 cherry-pick independently.
5. P8 is the only destructive commit and stays last.
6. Stacked PRs (P1–P3, then P4 / P5 / P6) are optional for parallel review.

## 12. Risks and open decisions

**Risks**

- **Hive code is not in this repo.** Paper imports `backend.research_hive_memory`,
  `research_hive_communication`, `research_hive_contracts` — present on no branch.
  Recovering it (review branch `review/hive-fit-20260911` or external volume) lets P2
  port instead of re-derive, and guarantees parity with published results.
- **Legacy tumor sim is not bit-reproducible** (global `np.random` / `random`). P5 gate
  is metric parity within tolerance, after which the engine becomes the reference.
- **Frontend** changes are out of scope; P8 preserves response shapes.

**Decisions**

1. Recover the hive code, or rebuild memory/admission from the paper spec?
2. Keep the legacy ant sim (`/simulation/run`) as a world, or drop it?
3. Build all 8 phases, or stop after P5 (~5,000 LOC) and reassess?

## 13. Honest scope of claims

Consistent with `VISION.md` and `RULES.md`: the engine is research and provenance
infrastructure. The tumor world is a synthetic 2D model, not clinical software.
A cross-world result, positive or negative, is reported with the same pre-registered,
paired-seed methodology as the DeSci paper; agreement is not truth, and `staged` is
not `verified_onchain`.

## 14. Parity with the paper's hive modules (added after import)

The C0–F3 modules from solmonger's review packet (`review/hive-fit-20260911`
@ `c37923e`) now live in `backend/research_hive_*.py`, byte-identical and
hash-checked against the packet manifest.

**Verified equivalent** (`tests/engine/test_trust_parity.py`): for the same
scenarios, engine `EvidenceMemory` and `HiveMemoryStore` leave the same set of
*usable* evidence — source replacement, contradiction cascade, cross-arm
refusal, tamper detection on open, record-size bounds, and 15 randomized
E13-shaped sighting/pickup streams (600 checkpoints, 0–6 usable facts).

**Intended differences**

| Topic | Hive store | Engine | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keying | source lineage (`source_id` + `source_revision`) | subject + subject revision | signals name subjects (a zone, a food); same invalidation semantics |
| Admission | claims `retained`; only an evaluator admits procedures | claims admitted after N distinct-author confirmations (default 1) | E13's harness auto-admitted every sighting via a pilot evaluator, i.e. N = 1 |
| Superseded status | `superseded` for the replaced record | `invalidated` (reason `source_replaced`) | one "not usable" status; reason is kept |
| Contradiction resolution | none | authority-only `resolve()` | lets a verifier restore the winner |
| Recall | substring query over admitted procedures | subject/kind filter, local selectors | structured recall for worlds |
| Transport | recipient-addressed request/reply; conflicting replies quarantined | range/topic broadcast signals + `AdmissionPolicy` | stigmergy; no quarantine equivalent yet |

**Task-DAG (E15)** is a verbatim port: functions are source-identical to
`run_e15.py`, admission bytes match on 3 arms × 20 seeds, and the admitted
DAGs from the paper's real LLM runs re-execute to the published 8 / 0 / 16.

## 15. P8 cutover — what was done and what remains

**Done**
- Engine API mounted in `backend/main.py` at `/engine/*` (local-only).
- Three legacy nanobot bugs fixed in `backend/nanobot_simulation.py`
  (payload deadlock, boundary snap, vessel overshoot; standalone commit),
  and the engine aligned with the fixed legacy.
- Dead code removed: root `app.py` (Streamlit; unreferenced, `streamlit` not a
  dependency) and `backend/cors_debug.py` (unused allow-all CORS helper).

**Deliberately not done** — the frontend still uses these, so deleting them
would break pages. Each needs a frontend migration (and, for the ant sim, a
product decision):

| Legacy | Used by |
|---|---|
| `backend/simulation.py` (ant sim) + `/simulation/run`, `/compare`, `/cache`, `/history` | home page `Index.tsx`, `SimulationComparison.tsx`, `ComparisonPanel.tsx` |
| `backend/tumor_hunt.py` + `/simulation/tumor/hunt` | `TumorHunt.tsx` |
| `backend/nanobot_simulation.py` + `/simulation/tumor/run` | `TumorSimulation.tsx` (animation frames) |
| `backend/litellm_client.py` | the three legacy simulators above |
| `backend/api_server.py` | `antelligence-api` entry point, README, tests |
