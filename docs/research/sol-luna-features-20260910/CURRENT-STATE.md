# Current state — review checkpoint, 2026-09-11

The operator asked to update memory/GitHub and prepare Antelligence for outside review before discussing best next steps. This supersedes the historical instructions to start C0 or resume the already completed F3 repair. Do not launch new feature workers as part of this checkpoint.

## Built versus integrated

| Work | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| C0 common evidence/outcome contracts | Accepted/frozen locally | `c5f59de5b7359664606a211a5e98ce22ab6291af` |
| F1 lineage-aware evidence memory | Accepted/frozen locally | `bf09e21cc1d1e45f41b172dde6ae516cbc038088` |
| F2 bounded tasks and verifier | Accepted/frozen locally | `8d9998c3c8db8936314d71e6416d1427c8710558` |
| F3 evidence communication and planner gating | Accepted/frozen locally | `81e6289149f3f4a743ba046c494acad4f37258cd` |
| Legacy compatibility/efficacy pilot | Executed, developmental only | `/Volumes/WD_BLACK/antelligence-fit-pilot`, `a4001f12c19d8fc77a29f8017347cbdf564e3f96` |
| F5 replay, F4 recovery, F6 model comparison | Pending | Existing specs retain their gates; provider quota last blocked, not re-probed |
| Live application integration/promotion | Not performed | Separate combined verification/review remains required |

F3 historical acceptance: `/Volumes/WD_BLACK/antelligence-collective-20260908/sol-luna-features-20260910/F3/run-04/ACCEPTANCE.json`. Its 209-test controller result and source review are historical receipts. Reviewer found no code defects but could not hash snapshots with restricted tools; controller independently bound them. Do not rewrite the reviewer verdict as unconditional procedural acceptance.

## What the pilot actually found

24 variants per condition, five methods, 480 recorded/replayed method-condition rows. Missing or explicitly invalidated memory plus a correct reply recovered completion in every assigned case; no-reply conditions stopped before actions. A simple solver with all current facts already completed every condition. Unreported source drift still admitted stale memory in 24/24 diagnostic cases; current-state verification rejected those plans. No model inference, held-out experiment, general accuracy advantage, clinical efficacy or cost/latency gain was established.

## Review artifact

- Isolated branch `review/hive-fit-20260911`, worktree `/Volumes/WD_BLACK/antelligence-review-20260911`, based on public `origin/main` rather than publishing the local development history.
- Initial packaging candidate `a0f3565482153c6367c19c8360499edc84f76fcc`; independently rechecked final candidate `c37923eb2af04ed855b276f7d5dfc642df5d0673`.
- Start at `REVIEW.md`, then `review/hive-fit-20260911/README.md` in that branch. Includes portable source/tests/runner, observed summaries, limitations and review questions.
- Fresh isolated environment: 165 initial included tests pass; two additional packaging regressions failed before repair, then all 167 pass. 480 rows and 24 drift controls reproduced the original summary exactly; moved-directory audit also passes. This subset is not the full historical controller suite or a whole-application health check.
- Source snapshots are hash-bound; no raw private process logs, credentials, local paths, databases or private development history are intended for publication.
- Independent packaging review and fresh delta recheck cleared DRAFT sharing only. Draft [PR #13](https://github.com/solmonger/antelligence-app/pull/13) is open at the exact final candidate; GitHub head, draft state, body, entry guide, source manifest and result summary were read back. Remote CI is recorded separately in the Vault handoff; no merge/deployment or whole-app approval.

## Decision to discuss

Whether ordinary retrieval plus a capable solo is sufficient, or selective memory/consultation warrants one source-backed workbench experiment. Require same-model controls, actual tokens/calls/time, wrong answers and abstentions, and both reported/unreported source changes. Do not presume all remaining features must ship before proving value. No paid experiment or provider fallback is authorized by this handoff.
